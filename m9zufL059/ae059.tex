		{\bf \item In a random experiment, the dice are rolled forty times and the numbers rolled are recorded in the table below.}
		
		\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
			Number of eyes & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6\\
			\hline
			Number of litters & 7 & 4 & 8 & & 6 &
		\end{tabular}
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Specify the relative frequency of the number 3.
			\item The relative frequency of the number 4 is 12.5%. How many times was the 4 rolled?
			\item Specify the absolute frequency of the number 6.
			\item What is the relative frequency for the event "Throw at most one three"?
		\end{enumerate}
		
		{\bf \item A random experiment consists in throwing a Laplace cube.} Decide whether for $\Omega_1=\{1,~2,\dots,~6\}, \quad \Omega_2=\{\textnormal{none}~6,~6\}$ and
			$\Omega_3=\{\textnormal{even number, odd number}\}$ there is a Laplace experiment.
			
			{\bf \item A dice is rolled. The result space is $ \Omega=\{1,~2,\dots,~6\}$.} Calculate the probability of the following events:
			\begin{enumerate}[A:]
				\item "A 6 is thrown"
				\item "An even number is thrown"
				\item "At most a 2 is thrown"
			\end{enumerate}
			
			{\bf \item The gender of a newborn child is considered a Laplace experiment, i.e. it is assumed that $P(w)=P(m)$.} \\
			What is the probability that a family with two children has at least one boy?
			
			{\bf \item A dice is rolled twice. What is the probability that the sum of the points is at least 10?}
			
			{\bf \item A Laplace coin is tossed three times.}
			\begin{enumerate}[a)]
				\item Illustrate the outputs using a tree diagram.
				\item Specify an appropriate result space.
				\item Calculate the probability of the following events:
				\begin{enumerate}[A:]
					\item "The same result appears three times"
					\item "It falls exactly twice coat of arms"
					\item "The number appears at most twice"
					\item "The second litter shows a coat of arms"
					\item "Only the second litter shows a coat of arms"
