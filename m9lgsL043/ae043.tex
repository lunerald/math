		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item The perimeter of an isosceles triangle is $\SI{20}{\centi\meter}$. Its base is $\SI{2}{\centi\meter}$ longer than the length of the legs.
			\item A merchant pays two bills in cash. He deducts a 2% discount from the invoice amount of one invoice and 3% from the other invoice. Altogether it's \EUR{144} in price reduction. If he kept a 2.5% discount on both invoices, he would get a combined €140 discount.
			\item 3 liters of punch with a fruit content of 50% should be mixed from orange nectar with a fruit content of 30% and apple juice with a fruit content of 80%. How much apple juice and how much orange juice must be mixed proportionately for this?

		{\bf \item A parallelogram has the area of $\SI{12}{\centi \meter^2}$ and the perimeter of $\SI{18}{\centi \meter}$.} The side b is half as long as side a. Calculate the side lengths and height of the parallelogram. To do this, set up a system of linear equations.
		
		{\bf \item A coffee manufacturing company wants to bring a new cappuccino onto the market.} 10 kg are to be produced as a sample. For the mixture, cocoa powder is used at \EUR{5} per kg and coffee powder at \EUR{8} per kg. The production price for the 10 kg sample is \EUR{68}. Calculate the proportion of cocoa powder and the proportion of coffee powder for this sample in kg. To do this, set up a system of linear equations.
		
		{\bf \item A rectangle has a circumference of $\SI{28}{\centi \meter}$.} If you lengthen the shorter side by $\SI{2}{\centi \meter}$ and shorten the longer one Side by $\SI{1}{\centi\meter}$, you get a new rectangle. the area of the new rectangle is $\SI{8}{\centi\meter^2}$ larger than the area of the original rectangle. \\
		How long are the sides of the original rectangle?
		
		{\bf \item An isosceles triangle has a circumference of $\SI{26}{\centi\meter}$.} One leg is five times as long as the third part of the base. \\
		How long are the legs and base?
		
		{\bf \item The difference in the lengths of the two base sides of a trapezoid is $\SI{4}{\centi\meter}$.} The height of this trapezoid is $\SI{3}{\centi\meter}$, the Area $\SI{21}{\centi\meter^2}$\\
		Calculate the lengths of the two base sides.
		
		{\bf \item In a parallelogram $ABCD$, the angle with measure $\alpha$ is $30^\circ$ larger than the angle with measure $\beta$.} Calculate the measures of the 4 interior angles of the parallelogram.
		
		{\bf \item A two-digit number is 22 larger than its triple sum.} Its ones digit is 1 smaller than the tens digit. What's the number? {\it Determine the variables, set up the equation and solve it!}
