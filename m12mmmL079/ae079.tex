	{\bf Three "at least" tasks}
	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		{\bf \item An advertising campaign promises: "There is a Star Wars figure in every seventh surprise egg".}
		How many surprise eggs do you have to open at least in order to find at least one Star Wars figure with a probability of at least 90%?
		{\bf \item 9\% of all cars are blue.}
		What is the minimum number of cars passing by that you have to count in order to have a greater than 95\% probability of seeing at least one blue car?
		{\bf \item There are 10 balls in an urn, red and blue.}
		What must be the minimum proportion of red balls in the urn so that after drawing and replacing ten times you get at least one red ball with a probability of more than 90%?
		{\bf \item How many acquaintances do you have to ask at least their date of birth} so that you have a probability of more than 50\% of meeting at least one with the same date of birth as you?

			{\bf \item The adjacent wheel of fortune is considered.} The letter A means winning a gold-plated floating duck. What is the minimum size of sector A (in degrees) so that there is at least a 90\% probability of winning at least one swimming duck when you spin it eight times?
