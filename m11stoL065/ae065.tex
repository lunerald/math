		%Task 1
		{\bf \item A university offers, among other things, two courses of study: business administration (business administration) and social pedagogy.} The following events are considered for data collection:\\
		M: "An arbitrarily selected new student is male" \\
		B: "An arbitrarily chosen new student studies business administration"
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Describe the event $E_1=\overline{M} \cup B $ in words.
			\item In a VENN diagram, label the event $E_2=\overline{\overline{B} \cup M}$.
			Describe this event in words.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		%Exercise 2
		{\bf \item A company produces plastic housings. The quality of the housings is checked for material defects and shape deviations through regular checks at the end of production.} Quality control is therefore defined by two events:\\
		M: "The tested housing has a material defect"\\
		Q: "The tested housing has a shape deviation"
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Describe the event $E_3= F \cup M $ in words.
			\item Use event algebra to describe the event: "At most one error occurs in quality control".
			\item In a VENN diagram, label the event
			$E_4=\overline{F \cap \overline{M}}$. Describe this event in words.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		
		{\bf \item $A$ and $B$ are events from a result space $\Omega$ of a random experiment. It applies:}
		$$ P(A)=\frac{3}{4} ; \hspace{15 pt} P(\bar{B})=\frac{2}{3} ; \hspace{15 pt} P(A \cap B)= \frac{1}{6} \, . $$
		Write the following events in set notation and calculate their probabilities for each:
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item $E_1$: At least one of the two events occurs.
			\item $E_2$: At most one of the two events occurs.
		\end{enumerate}
