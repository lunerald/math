	\begin{enumerate}[1.]
		
		
		{\bf \item As part of a quiz show, the number of tasks to be solved by a candidate} from the mathematics department is equal to the sum of the points that he scores by rolling two special dice once. The two dice each have the number 0 on two sides, the number 1 on three sides and the number 2 on one side.
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item Calculate the probability that the first candidate has to solve exactly two mathematics problems!
			\item The random variable $ X $ describes the number of tasks to be solved by a candidate. In a table the probability of $X$ can be represented:
			
			\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
			\begin{centering}
				\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c}
					$ x_i $ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
					\hline
					$ P(X=x_i) $ & & & $ \frac{13}{36} $ & & \\
				\end{tabular}
			\end{centering}\\
			Find the missing values of the probability distribution and the expected value of $X$.
			
			
			\item In order to raise money for a good cause, the broadcast management is offering a competition among the studio guests. For \EUR{2}, a player can remove 3 balls without replacing them from a container that contains three red, three green and three blue balls. If the three balls are the same color, the player wins a certain amount of money $B$, otherwise he loses and receives no payout. The drawn balls are then placed back into the container. Show that in a game the probability of winning is $ \frac{1}{28} $.
			
			\item Calculate what amount of money $ B $ the broadcasting company has to pay out in the event of a win, so that on average an income of \EUR{1.25} per game can be expected for the broadcasting company to donate to a good cause.
		\end{enumerate}
		%Exercise 2
		{\bf \item There are the following numbers on a die: 1,1,4,5,5,5}
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item The die is rolled 10 times.
			\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
				\item What is the probability of getting exactly five ones?
				\item What is the probability of getting at least four and at most eight ones?
			\end{enumerate}
			\item After you have deposited \EUR{3.90}, you can throw the dice once and the number you rolled is paid out in euros. Calculate the average net profit you can expect with this rule of the game.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		%Task 3
		{\bf \item The LEUCHTFIX company produces light bulbs, although experience shows that 3.0\% of the manufactured light bulbs are defective.}
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item A customer randomly selects 12 manufactured light bulbs. What is the probability that there are exactly two defective lamps among these light bulbs?
			\item How great would the probability of defects in production have to be in order to select at least one defective light bulb with a probability of more than 90%?
		\end{enumerate}
		
		{\bf \item Every patient (independent of other patients) stays in an eye clinic for a minimum of 3 days and a maximum of 5 days.} The administration uses the following probability distribution for the length of stay $X$ of a patient:
		
		$$
		\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2}
		\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			x_i & 3 & 4 & 5 \\
			\hline
			P(X=x_i)& 0.6 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\
			\hline
		\end{array}
		$$
		Each patient pays a one-off fee of \EUR{100} for admission to the clinic and then an additional fee of \EUR{450} for each day of stay. Determine the probability distribution and use it to determine the expected value and standard deviation for the random variable:
		$$ Y : \textnormal{Income of the clinic per patient in \EUR{}}$$
