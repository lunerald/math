		{\bf The goat problem}
		\vspace{0.5 cm}
		
		There is a competition to win a sports car. To do this, a candidate must choose the correct one of three closed doors. There is a goat behind two doors and a sports car behind one door.

	\vspace{1.5 cm}
	
	\noindent The game is played as follows: The candidate points to a door. The showmaster knows which door the car is behind and then opens it
	a door with a goat behind it. The candidate is given the opportunity to change their initial choice and select the remaining door.
	\vspace{1.5 cm}
	
	
	\noindent What needs to be discussed here is whether the candidate should make use of this option. Calculate the probability of winning by playing through all possible cases.
	\vspace{1.5 cm}
	
	
	\noindent What interesting and unexpected conclusion emerges?
