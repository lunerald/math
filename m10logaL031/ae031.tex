		{\bf \item Solve the following exponential equation: $$ 2 \cdot 1,2^{2x} = 5 \cdot 2^x $$}
		
		%Task 4
		{\bf \item At the beginning of the observation period, a radioactive preparation contains 140 active nuclei,} which decay into inactive daughter nuclei by releasing radioactive radiation. 1.5\% of active nuclei decay every second. When did the radioactivity of the material drop to 42\% of the original value?
		
		{\bf \item Write as the sum or difference of simple logarithms} \\
		$ ( a, b \in \mathbb{R}^+; a \ne 1 ) $
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item $ \log_{5}{ \left( \sqrt[4]{5ab} \right)} $
			\item $ \log_{a}{ \left( \frac{14a}{b^4} \right)} $
		\end{enumerate}
		
		{\bf \item Combine as much as possible } $ ( a, b, c \in \mathbb{R}^+; a \ne 1 ) $ \\
		$$ \log_{a}{b^{-0.25}} - 0.5 \log_{a}{b} + 0.4 \log_{a}{ \left( \frac{\sqrt{b} }{b^2} \right)} $$
		
		{\bf \item The population of an oryx antelope is determined by the function}
		$$ f(t) = 20000 \cdot 3^{-0.3t} ; \quad D_f = [0;20] $$
		($t =$ number of years). Find out when inventory is down to 25% of
		initial inventory.
		
		{\bf \item Determine the solution set of the following exponential equation over the basic set }
		$ \mathbb{G} = \mathbb{R} $ .
		$$ 5^{2x+1} - 3 \cdot 5^{x+2} + 250 = 0$$
		
		{\bf \item Calculate the base:} $$ \log_x{\sqrt[3]{0,5}} = \frac{2}{3} $$
		
		{\bf \item Simplify as much as possible: }
		$$ \log_5{(x^5 \cdot 5^{2x})} + 5 \cdot \log_5{\frac{25}{x}}$$
		
		{\bf \item Due to ongoing water pollution, the population of a fish species in a lake is declining by around 9\% every year.} There are currently around 50,000 fish of this species in the lake.
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item How large is the inventory after x years?
			\item The authorities want to react if the fish population has decreased by 20,000 specimens. How long will it take for them to take action?
			\item The authorities' measures are causing the fish population to grow again by 6\% per year. After how long will the original fish population be reached again?
		\end{enumerate}
		
		{\bf \item Mr. Mandelmeier buys a new car for \EUR {47900}.} This car loses 23\% of its residual value every year. Set up the appropriate functional equation for the residual value y \EUR{} after x years and then calculate how old the vehicle is when resold if the owner achieves a sales price of \EUR {4550}. Round sensibly!
		
		%Task 3
		{\bf \item A capital $K_0$ earns interest at $p\%$. The interest is added annually to the capital $K_0$.} Show in general by calculation that the (measure of the) time $x$ until the capital $K_0$ multiplies by $n$ depends only on the interest rate $p$ and the factor $n$ (the “result” should be an equation solved for $x$).
		
		{\bf \item Simplify as much as possible}
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item $ \log_a{ \left( \frac{1}{a} \right)^2} \cdot \log_c{ \left( \frac{1}{c} \right)} -
			\log_x{ \left( \frac{1}{x^3}\right)} \cdot \log_{b}1 $
			\item $ \lg{a^5} - \lg{a^4 b} + \lg{\frac{b}{a}} + \lg{\sqrt{b^5}} $

		{\bf \item Ms. Müller would like to invest a certain amount.} She invests the first half of the amount for 10 years with an annual interest rate of 5 \%. At what annual interest rate would she have to invest the second half so that the second half would grow to the same amount in 7 years as the first half would grow in 10 years?

		{\bf \item Determine $x$.}
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item $\frac{ 5^{x+1}}{2^x} = $78,125
			\item $ \log_{\sqrt{x}}{\frac{1}{27}} = -3 $
			\item $ \log_x7 = \frac{1}{3} $

		{\bf \item There are 14,000 type A bacteria and 5,000 type B bacteria in a nutrient solution.} Type A bacteria double every hour, while type B bacteria multiply by 130\% every half hour. After how long will there be the same number of bacteria of both types in the nutrient solution?
		
		
		{\bf \item A chemical company commits to reducing its pollutant emissions by 14\% by 2028 compared to 2016 levels.} Decide by calculation whether this goal can be achieved by an annual percentage decrease of 1.25\%.
		
		{\bf \item Rearrange the term and determine the variable:}
		
		\begin{enumerate}[a)]
			\item $5^x = $0.04
			\item $ \log_{7}{ \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{2401} } \right)}=c $
